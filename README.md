Morphkit is a Python toolkit for Greek morphological analysis and tag similairity comparison. It uses [Betacode library](https://github.com/perseids-tools/beta-code-py), the API of Morpheus (e.g., running in a [Docker virtualisation environment](https://hub.docker.com/r/perseidsproject/morpheus-api)) and the [Sandborg-Petersen morphological decoder](https://github.com/tonyjurg/Sandborg-Petersen-decoder).

## Documentation

For documentation see [tonyjurg.github.io/morphkit](https://tonyjurg.github.io/morphkit/)

## Package

For the actual code see [/morphkit](https://github.com/tonyjurg/morphkit/tree/main/morphkit)

## Loading

Since it is not a 'real' package (i.e., installable with `pip`), you need to load it locally. For example in a Jupyter Notebook:

```Python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, "..")    # the relative path for the morphkit directory to your notebook dir
import morphkit
```

## Tools used

The standard set of tools ([Python documentation](https://www.python.org/doc/), tech sites like [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), and Python syntax checkers like [Pythonium](https://pythonium.net/linter)) were used to create this package. Furthermore, for the creation of a subset of features, also the [Anaconda Assistant](https://www.anaconda.com/capability/anaconda-assistant) (using [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) as backend) and [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) in Visual Studio were used to debug and/or optimize parts of the code.
